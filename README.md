# Game of life

A little implementation of the Conward's game of life, the logic is simple and not clean, but it works with the standard rules of the game.

## Steps to run
**Note:** I only check this on linux, and the clear function that is in the main.go file doesn't support windows.

To run just **go run main.go** and that is it, you can play around with the size of the grid modifying the file.
